# TicTacTerminal
it is tictactoe for in your terminal

but how do YOU run this project of mine?
i have made 2 executable files one for linux wich i was working on and one for windows,
simply run these files and a terminal will popup.

my goal with this project was to start learning c++,
i'm pretty happy with how far i have gotten at this point of course the game is not done but the baseline is there.

while making this project i learned a bit about the basic fundamentals of c++ and
what 'references' and 'nested ternary operators' are and i was exited to use them in my code.

this project is not done and there is still some work to do.

while working on this project i found myself stuck learning the fundemantels of c++.
i am able to think an spit out code very easely in python but doing the same thing in c++ was though.
eventually i ended up in a long debugging session with my friend chatgpt and he introduced references and nested ternary operators,
i was confused and exited at the same time so i interegated chatgpt and wringed all the information he had on the subject in question out of him.
when i felt confortable i decided to use it in my code and put a detailed note asside the code so i could come back to it later.

i also learned that in c++ i have to think very differently then with python,
python simply does not give a sh*t and you are able to write just about anything your tiny wringeld-up brain can spit out,
in c++ i had to give everything i did a second thought.

i shot myself in my foot numerous times with my own stupid code and instead of going to the doctor to amputate it,
i tried to fix it myself by trying to get the bullet out of my foot with a knife and if i got the bullet out i was left with a way bigger wound then it first was.
and it did not solve anything i made my problems bigger.
that is the best way i could describe shooting myself in my foot with c++.
